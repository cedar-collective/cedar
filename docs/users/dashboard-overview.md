# Dashboard Overview

When you first open CEDAR, you'll see a navigation menu on the left and a main content area on the right. This page walks you through the main sections.

## Navigation

The left sidebar contains the main sections of CEDAR:

| Section | What It Does |
|:--------|:-------------|
| **Enrollment** | View enrollment trends by department, subject, or course |
| **Headcount** | Count students by major, classification, or program |
| **Course Reports** | Deep dive into a specific course |
| **Department Reports** | Comprehensive reports for a department |

## The Basic Workflow

Most CEDAR analyses follow this pattern:

1. **Select filters** — Choose a department, term range, or other criteria
2. **Click "Refresh Data"** — Load the data matching your filters
3. **Explore the results** — View charts, tables, and summaries
4. **Download if needed** — Export data or reports

## Understanding Filters

Filters let you narrow down what data you're looking at:

### Common Filters

| Filter | What It Does | Example |
|:-------|:-------------|:--------|
| **Department** | Limits to courses offered by a department | "HIST" shows History courses |
| **Subject** | Limits to a specific subject code | "ANTH" shows Anthropology courses |
| **Term** | Limits to specific semester(s) | "202580" is Fall 2025 |
| **College** | Limits to a specific college | "AS" is Arts & Sciences |
| **Campus** | Limits to a specific campus | "Main", "ABQ", etc. |

### Term Codes Explained

CEDAR uses 6-digit term codes. Here's how to read them:

| Code | Semester |
|:-----|:---------|
| 202510 | Spring 2025 |
| 202560 | Summer 2025 |
| 202580 | Fall 2025 |
| 202610 | Spring 2026 |

The pattern is: **YYYY** (year) + **T** (term type) + **0**

- **10** = Spring (starts in January)
- **60** = Summer (starts in June)
- **80** = Fall (starts in August)

## Refreshing Data

After setting your filters, click the **"Refresh Data"** button to load results. This is important — CEDAR doesn't automatically update when you change filters.

{: .note }
Large queries may take a few seconds. You'll see a loading indicator while data is being processed.

## Viewing Results

Results typically appear as:

- **Charts** — Interactive visualizations (hover for details, click legend items to show/hide)
- **Tables** — Sortable, searchable data tables
- **Summary statistics** — Key numbers at a glance

### Interactive Charts

CEDAR's charts are interactive:

- **Hover** over data points to see exact values
- **Click** legend items to show/hide series
- **Drag** to zoom in on a region
- **Double-click** to reset zoom

### Data Tables

Tables support:

- **Search** — Type in the search box to filter rows
- **Sort** — Click column headers to sort
- **Page** — Navigate through large datasets
- **Export** — Some tables have CSV download buttons

## Downloading Reports

Many sections offer download options:

- **CSV** — Raw data for use in Excel or other tools
- **HTML** — Formatted reports you can share or print
- **PNG** — Chart images

## Tips for New Users

1. **Start simple** — Pick one department and one term to get familiar with the interface
2. **Use the filters** — The more specific your query, the faster and clearer the results
3. **Explore the tabs** — Each tab within a section shows different views of the same data
4. **Check the date** — Look for "as of" dates to know how current the data is
