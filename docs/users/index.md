# User Guide

Welcome to CEDAR! This guide is for anyone who wants to use the web dashboard to explore enrollment data. **You don't need any programming experience.**

## What You Can Do

With the CEDAR dashboard, you can:

- **Track enrollment trends** over time for departments and courses
- **See who's taking courses** — majors, class levels, demographics
- **Generate department reports** with visualizations and tables
- **Explore student pathways** — where students come from and go next
- **Analyze registration patterns** and seat availability

## Getting Access

Your institution may already have a CEDAR dashboard running. Check with your:
- Department administrator
- Institutional research office
- IT department

If you're an administrator setting up CEDAR for the first time, see the [Installation Guide](../developers/installation.html).
