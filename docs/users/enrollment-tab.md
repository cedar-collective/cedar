# Enrollment Tab

The Enrollment tab is where you'll spend most of your time in CEDAR. It lets you explore enrollment patterns across departments, subjects, and courses.

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to **Enrollment** in the left sidebar
2. Set your filters (department, term range, etc.)
3. Click **Refresh Data**
4. Explore the sub-tabs for different views

## Sub-Tabs

The Enrollment section has several sub-tabs:

### DESR Enrollment

This tab shows enrollment from the Daily Enrollment Status Report (DESR) — the official course section data.

**What you'll see:**
- Enrollment by term
- Enrollment by subject
- Section counts and average class sizes

**Good for:**
- Tracking overall department enrollment
- Comparing subjects within a department
- Identifying enrollment trends over time

### Course Details

Drill down into specific courses:

**What you'll see:**
- Enrollment history for a single course
- Section-by-section breakdown
- Instructor information (if available)

**Good for:**
- Preparing for course scheduling
- Understanding which sections fill quickly
- Comparing instructors or delivery methods

### Registration Status

See how students are registered:

**What you'll see:**
- Registered vs. dropped students
- Withdrawal patterns
- Registration timing

**Good for:**
- Understanding attrition in courses
- Identifying courses with high drop rates

## Reading the Charts

### Enrollment Over Time

The main enrollment chart shows total enrollment across terms.

- **X-axis**: Term (chronological)
- **Y-axis**: Total enrollment
- **Hover** for exact numbers

{: .tip }
Click on legend items to show/hide specific data series. This is useful when comparing many subjects.

### Stacked Bar Charts

Some views show stacked bars to compare components:

- Each color represents a different category (subject, level, etc.)
- The total bar height shows the overall enrollment
- Hover over segments to see individual values

## Common Questions

### Why don't the numbers match what I expected?

Several things can cause differences:

- **Term filters** — Make sure you've selected the terms you want
- **Status filters** — By default, CEDAR shows active courses (not cancelled)
- **Campus filters** — Check if you're filtering by campus
- **Crosslisted courses** — Enrollment may be spread across sections

### What's the difference between enrollment and headcount?

- **Enrollment** counts registrations (a student in 3 courses = 3 enrollments)
- **Headcount** counts unique students (a student in 3 courses = 1 head)

### How current is the data?

Look for the "as of" date, usually shown at the top of reports or in the data tables. CEDAR data is typically updated nightly during the academic year.

## Tips

1. **Compare terms of the same type** — Fall-to-fall comparisons are more meaningful than fall-to-spring
2. **Watch for anomalies** — A sudden drop might be a data issue, not a real trend
3. **Consider context** — Enrollment changes can reflect many things (new faculty, curriculum changes, external factors)
