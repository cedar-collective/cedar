# Enrollment Tab
The Enrollment tab lets you explore enrollment patterns across departments, subjects, and courses.

1. Navigate to **Enrollment** in the left sidebar
2. Set your filters
3. Click **Refresh Data**
4. Explore the sub-tabs for different views

## Enrollment Trends
The Enrollment Trends tab has two sub-tabs:

### DESR Enrollment
This tab shows enrollment a section-by-section list of course enrollment data. You can group data together (like term and department) to create visualizations over time.

### Class List
See how students are registered:

**What you'll see:**
- Registered vs. dropped students
- Withdrawal patterns
- Registration timing

**Good for:**
- Understanding attrition in courses
- Identifying courses with high drop rates

{: .tip }
Click on legend items to show/hide specific data series. This is useful when comparing many subjects.


## Low Enrollment Alerts
This tab uses the filters to focus on low-enrolled sections. 


## Common Questions

### Why don't the numbers match what I expected?

Several things can cause differences:

- **Term filters** — Make sure you've selected the terms you want
- **Status filters** — By default, CEDAR shows active courses (not cancelled)
- **Campus filters** — Check if you're filtering by campus
- **Crosslisted courses** — Enrollment may be spread across sections

### What's the difference between enrollment and headcount?

- **Enrollment** counts registrations (a student in 3 courses = 3 enrollments)
- **Headcount** counts unique students (a student in 3 courses = 1 head)

### How current is the data?

Look for the "as of" date, usually shown at the top of reports or in the data tables. CEDAR data is typically updated nightly during the academic year.

## Tips

1. **Compare terms of the same type** — Fall-to-fall comparisons are more meaningful than fall-to-spring
2. **Watch for anomalies** — A sudden drop might be a data issue, not a real trend
3. **Consider context** — Enrollment changes can reflect many things (new faculty, curriculum changes, external factors)
