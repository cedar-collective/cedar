# Department Reports

Department reports give you a comprehensive view of a department's enrollment, course offerings, and student outcomes. 

## Generating a Report

1. Navigate to **Department Reports** (under Reports in the sidebar)
2. Select a department from the dropdown
3. Click **Generate Interactive Report**
4. Wait for the report to load (this may take 10-30 seconds)

{: .note }
CEDAR tries to cache department reports so they don't need to be re-calculated all the time. 


## Report Tabs

### Headcount
Shows the number of **unique students** enrolled in a particular department, major, minor, or concentration. 

Students are only counted if they enrolled for at least one course. This obviously misses students who are taking a semester off, but it prevents counting students that have not been active but are still formally enrolled at the university.


### Credit Hours
Shows the total **EARNED credit hours** generated by the department.

**What you'll see:**
- Credit hours by term
- Credit hours by course level (lower, upper, graduate)
- Credit hours by faculty type (tenure-track, term, graduate assistants)


### Degrees
Shows **degrees awarded** by programs in the department.

**What you'll see:**
- Degrees by program
- Graduation trends over time
- Breakdown by degree type


### DFW (Grades)
Shows **D, F, and Withdrawal rates** for department courses, and how instructor averages compare to course averages.

{: .warning }
This section contains sensitive academic performance data and requires a password.


**Good for:**
- Identifying courses that need support
- Normalizing grade distributions across sections


## Downloading Reports
You can download a formatted HTML report, which includes all the visualizations and tables, formatted for printing or sharing via email.

1. Click **Download HTML Report**
2. Wait for the report to generate
3. The file will download automatically




## Common Questions

### Why is my department not in the list?

The dropdown shows departments that have course data in CEDAR. If your department is missing:
- It may use a different code than expected
- There may not be recent course data
- Contact your CEDAR administrator

### Why do the numbers seem off?

- **Check the term range** — Reports default to recent terms
- **Check for data currency** — Look at the "as of" date
- **Consider crosslisting** — Credit hours may be split

### Can I compare departments?

Currently, you need to generate reports separately for each department. A comparison feature is on the roadmap.
