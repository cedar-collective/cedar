# Department Reports

Department reports give you a comprehensive view of a department's enrollment, teaching, and student outcomes. They're perfect for annual reviews, planning meetings, or just getting a quick snapshot.

## Generating a Report

1. Navigate to **Department Reports** (under Reports in the sidebar)
2. Select a department from the dropdown
3. Click **Generate Interactive Report**
4. Wait for the report to load (this may take 10-30 seconds)

{: .note }
The first time you generate a report for a department, it takes longer because CEDAR is calculating all the metrics. Subsequent requests are faster.

## Tips for Using Reports

### For Annual Reviews

- Generate reports at the same time each year for consistent comparisons
- Use the credit hours by faculty type to understand teaching distribution
- Track headcount trends alongside enrollment

### For Program Review

- Focus on the headcount and degrees tabs
- Look at 5-year trends, not just year-over-year
- Consider external factors that might affect numbers

### For Planning

- Use credit hour data to inform faculty hiring
- Look at DFW rates when planning course support
- Track where students come from (majors tab in rollcall)

## Common Questions

### Why is my department not in the list?

The dropdown shows departments that have course data in CEDAR. If your department is missing:
- It may use a different code than expected
- There may not be recent course data
- Contact your CEDAR administrator

### Why do the numbers seem off?

- **Check the term range** — Reports default to recent terms
- **Check for data currency** — Look at the "as of" date
- **Consider crosslisting** — Credit hours may be split

### Can I compare departments?

Currently, you need to generate reports separately for each department. A comparison feature is on the roadmap.
