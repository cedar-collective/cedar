# Course Reports

Course reports let you take a deep dive into a specific course — its enrollment history, who takes it, where students come from, and where they go next.

## Generating a Course Report

1. Navigate to **Course Reports** (under Reports in the sidebar)
2. Select a course from the dropdown (e.g., "HIST 1110")
3. Click **Generate Course Report**
4. Wait for the report to load

{: .tip }
Start typing in the course dropdown to search. You can search by subject code (HIST) or course number (1110).

## Report Sections

Course reports include several tabs:

### Enrollment
- Enrollment by term (bar or line chart)
- Section counts
- Average section size
- Capacity utilization

**Good for:**
- Understanding enrollment trends and needs
- Identifying overall growth or decline


### Course Flows
Shows where students come from before taking this course, and where they go after. This includes a Sankey diagram showing top courses took before or after the course.

**Good for:**
- Understanding course sequencing
- Identifying prerequisite patterns
- Seeing how courses connect in the curriculum

{: .note }
Course flow diagrams work best for courses that are part of sequences. Isolated electives may not show meaningful flows.


### Rollcall
Shows who's taking the course, including students by major, class level (freshman, sophomore, etc.), and various trends over time

**Good for:**
- Understanding your audience
- Identifying which programs send students
- Tailoring course content to student backgrounds

### DFW (Outcomes)

Shows academic outcomes for this course.

{: .warning }
This section requires a password due to sensitive grade data.

**What you'll see:**
- DFW rates by term
- DFW course abverages compared to instructor DFW averages
- Grade distribution

**Good for:**
- Identifying courses that need support


## Reading the Course Flow Diagram
The course flow (Sankey) diagram can be confusing at first glance but it's actually straigtforward. Here's how to read it:

1. **Left side** — Courses students took *before* this one
2. **Center** — The course you're analyzing
3. **Right side** — Courses students took *after* this one

The width of each flow shows how many students took that path. Note that only the top 8 or so courses are shown since showing every single class makes the diagram unreadable. 

**Example reading:**
> "200 students came from MATH 1215, and 150 of those went on to take PHYS 1310"


### Tips for Course Flows

- **Self-referencing flows** — If many students come from or go to the same course, they're retaking it
- **Thin flows** — May represent students exploring rather than a structured path
- **Missing flows** — Not all students have prior/next data (new students, graduates)


## Comparing Sections
Within the Enrollment tab, you can often see section-level detail:

- **By instructor** — Compare enrollment across instructors
- **By delivery method** — Online vs. in-person
- **By time slot** — Morning vs. afternoon sections


## Downloading Course Reports

## Common Questions

### Why is my course not in the list?

The dropdown shows courses with recent enrollment data. If your course is missing:
- It may not have been offered recently
- Check if you're using the correct subject code
- Contact your CEDAR administrator


### Why are the course flows empty?
Course flows require:
- Sufficient enrollment history
- Students who take other courses (not just this one)
- Multiple terms of data

New courses or isolated electives may not have meaningful flow data.

### How far back does the data go?
This depends on your institution's available data. Check with your CEDAR administrator for specifics.
